# Showreel Kit v2

Build **one showcase website a day**, with a **different design every day**, film it vertically and post it on Instagram to win clients.

- **The engine stays the same:** smooth scrolling, scroll-driven video, loader, custom cursor, reveal animations, and a record mode that scrolls the page by itself for filming.
- **The design is new every time:** Claude Code designs each site from scratch (layout, nav, fonts, cards, page flow), using the pattern library as ingredients and the design menu to avoid repeating itself.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000   → the current site
                     # http://localhost:3000/patterns → the pattern library
```

## Make today's site (with Claude Code)

Open Claude Code in this folder:

```
/new-site Day [N] — [Brand], a premium saree store in Chennai. Audience: brides and families. Mood: festive, rich, graceful. Assets: none yet.
```

It works in **4 steps** and stops after each for your OK:

0. **Design direction** → `site/DESIGN.md`: the look, colours, fonts, nav, hero, section plan, and which images/videos to generate (with prompts).
1. **Structure** → builds `site/`. Review with motion off: `http://localhost:3000/?static=1`
2. **Motion** → tunes the hero and the signature moment. Send a slow screen recording.
3. **Polish** → readability, phone, filming length, saves the site to `archive/` and logs it.

Then film it: `docs/RECORDING.md`.

## Make a story site (fan-made, from film footage)

Put the footage in `raw/<story>/src/`, then:

```
/new-story Story — [film/character]: [the arc in a few words]. Mood: [3 words].
```

It builds a chapter-by-chapter site from clips of the footage, with a credit line ("Fan-made concept, not affiliated") at the end. The footage never goes into git, and the repo must stay private. Full steps: `docs/STORY-WORKFLOW.md`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Run the site while you edit |
| `npm run build && npm start` | Production version: **use this when filming** |
| `npm run frames -- <video> <folder>` | Turn a video into scroll frames |
| `npm run check` | Check all images/frames used in `site/` exist |
| `npm run archive -- day-NN-slug` | Save the current site into `archive/` |
| `npm run restore -- day-NN-slug` | Bring a saved site back |
| `npm run story:*` | Story mode tools (`init`, `scan`, `clips`, `frames`, `record`, `check`): see `docs/STORY-WORKFLOW.md` |

Frames options: `--zoom 1.2` (hide AI watermark) · `--start 1 --end 7` (trim) · `--max 120` (fewer frames) · `--reverse`

## Record mode (filming)

`http://localhost:3000/?record=1`: hides cursor + scrollbar, then scrolls the whole page by itself.
`&duration=30` = whole page in 30 s · `&speed=200` = fixed speed · keys: **R** start/stop, **T** top, **+/−** speed.
