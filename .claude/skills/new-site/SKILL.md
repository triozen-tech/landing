description: Build a new showcase website in this Showreel Kit from a short brief (brand, mood, assets), with a fresh design every time. Use when the user asks for a new site, a new brand, "today's site", or to redesign a site. For a fan-made site from film footage use /new-story.

# New showcase site

The user gives a brief like: *"Day [N] — [Brand], a sneaker brand. Black and neon green, energetic. Hero video in raw/hero.mp4."*

Follow `CLAUDE.md` → "Building a new site — Round 0 + 5 rounds". Never skip a round, and stop after each round for the user's "ok". Explain things in plain simple language.

**The repo shows only the current project** (see `CLAUDE.md`): old sites live in their own day folders; git holds only today's site, the engine, the pattern library and the kit docs.

- **Round 0 — Design direction:** first delete the previous site's images and frames (`public/images/<old-slug>/`, `public/frames/<old-slug>-*`) and any demo assets, so only the new site's assets exist. Read `docs/SITES-LOG.md` + `docs/DESIGN-MENU.md` + `docs/MOTION-MENU.md`, pick one option per menu (≥ 6 of 8 different from each of the last 3 sites), plan 9–12 sections (hero + cinematic + shop-style), write `site/DESIGN.md`, list missing assets with prompts. The "different from the last sites" table goes in `docs/SITES-LOG.md` only (never in `DESIGN.md`, so old names never enter the repo). Wait for approval.
  - **`DESIGN.md` must include a "Motion map" table** (template at the end of `docs/MOTION-MENU.md`): every section, loader, nav and footer included → **one motion code** (M1–M37), how it plays here, phone fallback, record mode. **No code used twice. "Just fade in" is not allowed** as any section's motion. The hero and signature must not repeat **any** earlier site's hero or signature (check every row of `docs/SITES-LOG.md`, not just yesterday), and the hero must not be a "shape grows to full screen / portal" opening. Add the planned transitions (X codes) and details under the table.
- **Round 1 — Structure:** archive the old site, frames + images into per-site folders, install fonts, write `site/` from scratch (copy patterns into `site/components/` and restyle them), build the markup the Motion map needs, `npm run check` + `npm run build`. User reviews `http://localhost:3000/?static=1` (laptop + phone).
- **Round 2 — Big motion:** loader, hero, signature moment and every pinned / scroll-scrubbed section; everything interactive also plays by itself on screen. **Motion map check.** User sends a slow screen recording.
- **Round 3 — Section motion + transitions:** every other section gets its Motion map code, plus the transitions between sections. **Motion map check.** User sends a full-page recording.
- **Round 4 — Details + phone pass:** hover, cursor, micro-interactions (each with a hands-free version for filming), then a phone-only pass (375px) using each section's phone fallback. **Motion map check** (laptop + phone).
- **Round 5 — Polish, performance, archive:** readability, performance, `?static=1` final states, console clean, set `meta.record.duration` (25–40 s), add a row to `docs/SITES-LOG.md` (with the Motion column), `npm run archive -- <day-NN-slug>`. Then run `git ls-files` and confirm the repo holds only the current site's assets, the engine, the pattern library and the kit docs (no other brand names or images); report the list and total size. Reply with the filming steps from `docs/RECORDING.md`.
- **Motion map check (end of Rounds 2, 3, 4):** go through the Motion map section by section; the main move must be the planned code (not a fade), play without hover/click, and show its final state with `?static=1`. Fix any that don't match, and report a short table: section · code · ✅ / fixed.
- **Pattern library:** demos on `/patterns` use plain colour placeholders or the current site's images, never an old site's.
